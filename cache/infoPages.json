They are called Storms, End game, Struggling synergies, and Opposing views. They do not claim to predict or project how the future may look like but offer strategic reflections, which can serve as a compass for policymakers for navigating through unchartered territories of turbulence, uncertainty, ambiguity and novelty.

<strong>CROSSEU project</strong> was launched in response to growing societal needs for effective climate action and stronger socio-economic resilience. As climate change continues to impact our world, it becomes crucial to understand and manage its complex effects.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Objective(s)</strong><br>CROSSEU aims to respond to increasing societal needs to reduce climate-damaging actions, adapt to the expected consequences, and increase socio-economic resilience. <br><br>The main ambition of the project is to provide a science based and ready to use decision support system built on enhanced understanding of the biogeophysical risks from climate change, and their socioeconomic impacts in Europe, fully co-produced and implemented with practice stakeholders to ensure its uptake, and support effective coping with sectoral and cross sectoral climate risks within the context of the European green transition.<br><br>It will do this by delivering a climate-sensitive framework, including a ready-to-use decision support system platform and technical recommendations, to inform investment decisions, cost-effective adaptation and mitigation options and policy response to climate change. <br><br>The project will contribute to advancing the understanding of the socio-economic risks and response options associated with climate change impact in Europe in different timeframes, including the post-COVID-19 societal-environmental transformation, and derive practical recommendations for political and societal action. <br><br>The solutions proposed are based on an extensive assessment of the socio-economic risks of climate change in a cross-sectoral hierarchical approach, based on storylines addressing key categories of climate hazards in different socio-economic sectors and climate change-sensitive areas across countries and European regions. <br><br>The project will offer a ready-to-use solution that integrates complex information from available climate risk data sets and non-climatic sectoral data collected during the project implementation and derived through modelling based on demand-driven climate-socio-economic pathways. <br><br>CROSSEU is designed to bridge the science-based information about the economic impacts of climate change, and the unique contributions of the project will be: <br><br>         1. the quantification of costs of existent and emergent socio-economic risks and opportunities at NUTS3 level<br>         2. an improved representation of adaptation within biogeophysical climate change risk <br>         3. a better consideration of modelling uncertainties by identifying their nature, assessing their characteristics in <br>             a systematic way to determine a better informed and robust decision-making.&nbsp;</p>\n","countryTag":[{"name":"EU","_id":"e1b13728-5253-484b-92d6-0c451813adff","_owner":"89c27159-d0d6-4d08-bdc0-ea92984d69a8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T10:28:23.621Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T10:28:23.621Z"},"tagType":"country"}],"title":"CROSSEU","internalLinks":[],"organisationMemberOf":[],"activity":[],"projectFunded":[{"popularity":27,"name":"EU

How can we equip ourselves and younger generations with the necessary tools and skills to navigate the unknown? This is where futures literacy comes into play. While no-one can truly predict the future, by integrating future thinking into education, we acquire the tools to anticipate and navigate the complexities of an uncertain world, fostering innovation, adaptability, and resilience, in line with the goals of the European Year of Skills (May 2023 – May 2024).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ed.ted.com/future-forward\" target=\"_blank\">Future Forward</a>, a 20-lesson  program offers a unique opportunity for parents, teachers, and anyone curious about the exploration of the future.

Explore your perception of time and the future from multiple perspectives to help develop your futures literacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>• Futures mindset; Learn to see the world as a futurist! By challenging assumptions, developing a critical gaze, and understanding the interconnectedness of the world, you can imagine possible and preferable futures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>• Multiple futures; There is no single future, but a landscape of constantly emerging and evolving possibilities. Contemplate a plurality of scenarios and visions for some of this century’s most pressing issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>• Investing in imaginations; How do we begin to imagine more than one viable future? When we open our imaginations, the possibilities become endless. We each have the capacity to explore, shape and imagine alternative futures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>• Taking action; Imagine your ideal world 20 years in the future. What does it look like? How can you achieve it? Learn how you can take an active role in creating a better and more positive tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>UNESCO champions a capability-based approach to using-the-future. Futures Literacy empowers the innate human capacity to imagine, it is a skill that everyone can develop. In becoming futures literate we enhance our agency, developing our abilities to identify novelty, prepare, adapt and invent as changes occur in the complex world we live in.

Several snapshots of the future depict different worlds that have undergone substantial changes as a consequence of emerging developments. An analysis of the risks inherent in the possible futures identified ten risk clusters that are relevant for decision makers, and mapped future developments that might lead to them.The same development pathways that could lead to risks can also create opportunities, and the study provides some examples. Decision makers face the challenge of mitigating the adverse effects of risks, while reaping the benefits of potential opportunities. This study also presents the results of a Delphi survey that evaluated the scope and severity of risks. Three of the 40 risks identified in this study were assessed to be potentially existential for humanity: 1) environmental degradation, 2) environmental disasters, and 3) loss of power by humans. The project started in 2023 and will run until 2024. Next in the development is an engagement tool for policymakers to push the boundaries of foresight on risks in their specific policy making domain.

The norm of civic participation in a ‘democracy’ is a lived ideal for citizens, just as the norm of ‘communalism’ is a lived ideal for the scientific community. Both norms presuppose the values of ‘openness’ and 'mutual responsiveness' among scientist and citizens.This highlights ‘openness’ not as a prescriptive norm but as a value of the institution of science. Simultaneously, ‘openness’ is also an institutional value of a democracy. However, science and democracy are dependent on the extent to which scientist and citizens engage on the basis of these norms.

This research project will take into account the evolution of Living Labs and various specialized Living Labs (e.g., urban labs, social labs, and responsible Living Labs) to assess to what extent they address these institutional requirements. On this basis, the concept of a new dedicated Living Lab: a Responsible Research and Innovation Lab for Engineering Practices will be introduced. Subsequently this dedicated Living Lab will be operationalised on a theme from the engineering sciences.

Specific job profiles range from farm drone operators, who operate and maintain drones that monitor, measure and analyze crop growth and health, to cybersecurity experts, who protect government data from digital attacks. To be prepared for the changing profiles, digital competencies need to be developed, which can be categorized into the following four pillars: digital literacy and data literacy, technology-specific skills, digital product literacy, and digital transformation literacy.</p>\n<p><br>After developing future scenarios and outlining future job profiles, <strong><em>recommendations</em></strong> were finally drawn up that will enable Tunisia to proactively strive for the future outlined. General recommendations manifest themselves, for example, in the promotion of a \"digital culture\" that includes all strata of the population in order to make appropriate use of the potential of digitization. A specific example of a topic area recommendation is to strive for leadership in green tech solutions. Here, it is recommended to promote green tech culture, for example by including environmental sustainability and green tech solutions in education and public campaigns. In addition to content recommendations, Foresight Journey recommendations aim to improve and deepen the methodological applications of foresight for potential future ventures in this thematic field.</p>\n<p><br><em>Smart Futures Tunisia is part of the Special Initiative “Decent Work for a Just Transition” Invest for Jobs of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and implemented by the Digital Transformation Programme Tunisia of the Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH.

In this project, foresight is both a tool for understanding democratic innovations as they emerge, and for engaging citizens and other actors in such innovations within the participatory and deliberative realms. Mixed method approaches to foresight that incorporate a diversity of activities such as media discourse analysis, lived experience storytelling, social media analysis, three horizons mapping, driver-mapping, scenario and visioning exercises and policy stress- testing have been used in <strong>EUARENAS</strong> to investigate and hypothesise over future trends and scenarios in participatory democracies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From this work, we propose the following recommendations for Cities wanting to strive towards more equitable local democracies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Address structural barriers to participation</li>\n<li>Build relationships of trust</li>\n<li>Invest in formal and civic education</li>\n<li>Make decisions for the long-term</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A more equitable, inclusive local democracy landscape is not too far in the distance for us to conceive it being possible. In fact, <strong>the future is now</strong> – the seeds to create it are already being planted, they just need nurturing by:<br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scaling and mainstreaming existing pilot or niche practices that are working locally – whether that beparticipatory budgeting, citizen assemblies or other smaller-scale projects – so that these become thenew ‘status quo’</li>\n<li>Adopting test and

Foresight was thus used in this case to direct public funds more effectively, thereby addressing the problems that need to be focused on with an eye to the future.</p>\n<p>https://www.ceskepriority.cz/foresight#co_je_foresight</p>\n","methods":[{"popularity":33,"name":"expert workshops","_id":"6c84e284-84b3-49dd-938d-3a5d8a9f7259","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.962Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.962Z"},"tagType":"foresight method"},{"popularity":34,"name":"interviews","_id":"36e5f3ff-5089-46ea-8d43-ae291ee9bd24","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.955Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.955Z"},"tagType":"foresight method"},{"popularity":46,"name":"modelling","_id":"271e5e0e-1be8-42a3-8f0e-87d0f83f2e55","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.951Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.951Z"},"tagType":"foresight method"},{"popularity":38,"name":"extrapolation","_id":"d34444fb-f15b-4122-9aad-0732bab462b7","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.961Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.961Z"},"tagType":"foresight method"},{"popularity":43,"name":"futures stories","_id":"f17b8201-5b2f-4b91-914e-0d266ea1312a","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.958Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.958Z"},"tagType":"foresight method"}],"pageTypes":[{"popularity":35,"name":"project info","_id":"fcb0cbbc-98a5-4743-8c8b-1cb1c8326a85","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:51:01.714Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:51:01.714Z"},"tagId":252527,"tagType":"page type"}],"projectCoordinator":[],"_id":"aa0d3565-db93-4a24-a3c2-abd7706c2f11","_owner":"d3268e01-e2ba-455a-81c4-d86515cf97f8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-26T15:09:44.461Z"},"organisationType":[],"postContentRIch3":"<p></p>\n","domains":[{"popularity":31,"name":"social innovation","_id":"dfef94c1-0a2b-4305-be91-66ace52b285b","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:25.065Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:25.065Z"},"tagType":"domain"},{"popularity":62,"name":"labour","_id":"e700ae98-8f34-42ee-bfce-88fadab6e2cf","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:25.078Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:25.078Z"},"tagType":"domain"}],"personOrganisationFormer":[],"personProjectParticipation":[],"postImage1":{"url":"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/471908_3750a6a3d1cb41b18285a52df09a2269~mv2.webp","caption":""},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-26T15:14:37.337Z"},"slug":"foresight-for-social-innovation-4ncy0","mediaFiles":[{"displayName":"","url":"","fileName":"","thumbnail":"","sizeInBytes":"","type":""}],"projectEndDate":"2023-03-31T21:00:00.000Z","projectStartDate":"2022-12-31T22:00:00.000Z","Project":[{"name":"Foresight for Social Innovation","_id":"95a8911e-ed76-4699-9955-637d8514ca1f","_owner":"d3268e01-e2ba-455a-81c4-d86515cf97f8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-26T15:07:43.870Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-26T15:09:47.426Z"},"tagType":"project","tagPageLink":"/project/foresight-for-social-innovation-4ncy0"}],"projectOrganisationRoles":[{"organisation":"Ceske Priority","role":""},{"organisation":"Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs from Czech Republic","role":""},{"organisation":"","role":""}],"projectOrganisation":[{"popularity":4,"tagline":"non-governmental and non-profit think-tank of researchers and public sector experts","name":"Ceske Priority","_id":"508dfceb-8f6c-454a-a30b-7e6441da6367","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.850Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.850Z"},"tagType":"organisation"},{"popularity":83,"name":"Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs from Czech Republic","_id":"246af3af-a9b4-4342-bcba-5b79d2d6c315","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.795Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.795Z"},"tagType":"organisation"}],"personProjectCoordonation":[],"person":[],"pageOwner":[],"personOrganisation":[],"postContentRIch1":"<p>We implemented the ForSI (<strong>For</strong>esight for <strong>S</strong>ocial <strong>I</strong>nnovation) project with the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, with the Unit of Social Innovation.

In order to ensure that this strategic document reflects the dynamic developments on the global and domestic scene, mechanisms for regular reviews and updates of the objectives and measures have been proposed. Given the events of the last 3 years (especially the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine), it is relevant to review the relevance of the assumptions regarding the long-term development of the Czech Republic, which served as the basis for the original wording of the strategic objectives and targeting of the document.<br>The role of České priority was to provide foresight exercises in order to reach two goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Assess the relevance of existing goals:</strong> the problems and challenges facing society are changing and so are the definition of objectives for further development. The task of this section is therefore also to determine whether the original ČR 2030 goals are still relevant in the context of change and respond to the major challenges that society is facing and will continue to face in the coming decades.</li>\n<li><strong>Identify blind spots: </strong>there may be issues or opportunities that the document does not cover - i.e. blind spots. The next task of this part of the update is to identify such gaps to increase the comprehensiveness of the document.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The project was implemented in the form of workshops, which were attended by experts and representatives of public institutions and ministries. On the basis of pre-prepared scenarios of development, the participants had to identify the resulting challenges, opportunities and areas that have not yet been covered in the CR 2030. The list of these areas was subsequently consulted with representatives of public institutions. These expert consultations were complemented by input from the general public through a creative competition held in September 2022.</p>\n<p>https://www.ceskepriority.cz/foresight#co_je_foresight&nbsp;</p>\n","methods":[{"popularity":36,"name":"scenarios","_id":"3c4917d4-7467-4fef-a6a3-af7b61b9e196","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.946Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.946Z"},"tagType":"foresight method"},{"name":"Expert Consultations","_id":"619268f4-d17b-44d3-83c5-25269c71831b","_owner":"d3268e01-e2ba-455a-81c4-d86515cf97f8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-26T13:00:32.237Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-26T13:00:32.237Z"},"tagType":"foresight method"}],"pageTypes":[{"popularity":35,"name":"project info","_id":"fcb0cbbc-98a5-4743-8c8b-1cb1c8326a85","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:51:01.714Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:51:01.714Z"},"tagId":252527,"tagType":"page type"}],"projectCoordinator":[],"_id":"2e2eb743-c070-4f7a-9017-6c5446a57ac9","_owner":"d3268e01-e2ba-455a-81c4-d86515cf97f8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-26T12:57:17.187Z"},"organisationType":[],"postContentRIch3":"<p></p>\n","domains":[{"name":"Public Policy","_id":"2bb9642d-dc5a-4fc3-a812-9f98e987705e","_owner":"89c27159-d0d6-4d08-bdc0-ea92984d69a8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-23T13:38:45.867Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-23T13:38:45.867Z"},"tagType":"domain"}],"personOrganisationFormer":[],"personProjectParticipation":[],"postImage1":{"url":"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/471908_878d8d8d74b44dd88368927310ab8e36~mv2.webp","caption":""},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-26T13:09:06.084Z"},"slug":"actualization-of-czech-republic-2030-strategy-63e2g","mediaFiles":[{"displayName":"","url":"","fileName":"","thumbnail":"","sizeInBytes":"","type":""}],"Project":[{"name":"Actualization of Czech republic 2030 strategy","_id":"c04a682a-4162-4c01-8ad0-10ed5ece8fe5","_owner":"d3268e01-e2ba-455a-81c4-d86515cf97f8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-26T12:55:54.930Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-26T12:57:19.812Z"},"tagType":"project","tagPageLink":"/project/actualization-of-czech-republic-2030-strategy-63e2g"}],"projectOrganisationRoles":[{"organisation":"Ceske Priority","role":""},{"role":""}],"projectOrganisation":[{"popularity":4,"tagline":"non-governmental and non-profit think-tank of researchers and public sector experts","name":"Ceske Priority","_id":"508dfceb-8f6c-454a-a30b-7e6441da6367","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.850Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.850Z"},"tagType":"organisation"}],"personProjectCoordonation":[],"person":[],"pageOwner":[],"personOrganisation":[],"postContentRIch1":"<p></p>\n","countryTag":[{"popularity":25,"name":"Czech Republic","_id":"870d0d9e-5988-4ad5-a4d4-8293d035a290","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.735Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.735Z"},"tagType":"country"}],"title":"Actualization of Czech republic 2030 strategy","internalLinks":[],"organisationMemberOf":[],"activity":[],"projectFunded":[],"organisationHasMember":[],"organisationPeople":[]},"_id":"2e2eb743-c070-4f7a-9017-6c5446a57ac9"},{"dataCollectionId":"InfoPages","data":{"projectParticipantTeam":[],"organisation":[],"personOrganisationRoles":[{"organisation":"","role":""}],"organisationProject":[],"methods":[{"name":"Experts Consultation","_id":"592aecc5-c20f-49b7-b524-dddefa4ad04c","_owner":"d3268e01-e2ba-455a-81c4-d86515cf97f8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-26T13:01:41.338Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-26T13:01:41.338Z"},"tagType":"foresight method"}],"pageTypes":[{"popularity":91,"name":"person info","_id":"ff988067-2fee-41f2-9b33-7eb14d282b17","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:51:01.715Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:51:01.715Z"},"tagId":252526,"tagType":"page type"}],"projectCoordinator":[],"description":"<p><strong>Foresight Training</strong><br><br>In this dynamically changing environment, leaders need to be equipped to think effectively about what's next.

The Big Brainstorm is like a global talent show on ideas. Young innovators from every corner of the world come together to brainstorm, design, and launch initiatives to tackle some of the biggest challenges humanity faces. This year, over 2,000 young minds have joined the Big Brainstorm, with nearly half of them proposing initiatives to speed up action towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Out of these, twenty initiatives were selected, and one of them is the <strong>Foresight for Intergenerational Decision-Making</strong>. The heart of this initiative is a <strong>toolkit designed to run multi-stakeholder Foresight exercises</strong>. Think of it as a DIY kit for the future, helping young people to build meaningful spaces where they can engage with adults, particularly decision-makers and the private sector, to co-create their vision for the future. The initiative is based on the belief that young people have innovative ideas and stories that can help shape the future. By using Foresight tools, they can engage in a process of co-creation, sharing their perspectives and visions for the future with decision-makers, and learning to anticipate both the opportunities and threats behind different scenarios.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This summer, the toolkit will be put to the test different locations. It's like a world tour for the future, with young leaders from the United Nations Foundation’s Big Brainstorm leading the charge. The toolkit is being designed with the help of Foresight practitioners who have hands-on experience in intergenerational spaces and field experience in the Majority World.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Currently, the forward thinkers behind the initiative have launched a global survey and conduct interviews to understand the fears and hopes of young people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Want to get involved ? You can </strong><a href=\"https://forms.gle/osmz4fLEUqucTaos8\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>complete the survey here</strong></a><strong>  and have the chance to connect with us at the end of the survey! </strong></p>\n<p>The Foresight for Intergenerational Decision-Making initiative is a big step towards a future-focused approach. It aims to provide young people with a toolkit for creating meaningful intergenerational spaces, create a platform for adolescents, young people, and Foresight practitioners to brainstorm together, and showcase examples of good practice that can be replicated across the world. The initiative is open to all young people and their allies who are willing to contribute to its goals and offer fresh insights. <strong>Any youth networks interested in leading the organization of piloting experiences are encouraged to get in touch with the Action Group. </strong></p>\n<p>In a nutshell, the Foresight for Intergenerational Decision-Making initiative is all about empowering young people to shape their futures. By giving them the tools and platforms to engage with decision-makers and the private sector, the initiative is nurturing a new generation of changemakers who are ready to tackle the world's most pressing challenges. The future is in our hands, and with the help of this initiative, young people are being given the tools to shape it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>So, let's roll up our sleeves and get ready to shape the future together! </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Contact the coordination team:</strong> felibosch3@gmail.com / chalalidaouia@hotmail.fr / salifi.alimou@gmail.com / Claudette.salinas10@gmail.com&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>The future generations movement has been growing for almost thirty years and was given a new lease of life after the 2021 report Our Common Agenda.

October 2022 to March 2023, we ran a forecasting tournament with a total of 54 questions. Almost all of our forecasting questions were developed in cooperation with 16 different public institutions and ministerial departments. Each institution or department defined its most useful forecasting topics, participated in a workshop to define specific questions with us, and was later provided with the results. This was intended as a proof of concept of one possible approach to incorporating forecasting in public decision-making.</p>\n<p><br>Once defined, our forecasting questions were then posted on a private Metaculus sub-domain (in Czech), where an average of 72 forecasters had the opportunity to address them as they would any other question on Metaculus (median of 18 predictions per user). Throughout the tournament, we produced 16 reports detailing the rationales and forecasts, to be used by the cooperating institutions.<br>A handful of our partners have already reported acting on the information/judgment presented in our reports. This has concerned, for example, the national foreclosure issue (some 6% of the total population have debts in arrears) where the debt relief process is being redesigned midst strong lobbying and insufficient personal capacities; or the probabilities of outlier scenarios for European macroeconomic development, which was requested by the Slovak Ministry of Finance to help calibrate their existing judgements.</p>\n<p><br>It also seems useful to explore various approaches to grow the number of policymakers with personal experience and skills in forecasting. In our case, we found curiosity and willingness to try forecasting even in unexpected institutional locations (i.e. the Czech R&amp;amp;I funding body). This makes us more confident that the “external forecasts” approach (as compared to building internal prediction tournaments or focusing on advancing forecasting skills of public servants) is worth investigating further precisely because it allows us to detect and draw on this interest irrespective of institutional and seniority distinctions and resource constraints.<br>While we hope that any readers with an interest in forecasting may find our experience useful, we expect that both this and any future projects of ours make it easier for other teams to work towards similar goals. To that effect, the write-up also contains an Annex of “Methodological Guidelines,” where we outline in more explicit terms the questions and decisions that we found were important to tackle when running the project, and what they may entail.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>de introdus homepage</p>\n","countryTag":[{"popularity":25,"name":"Czech Republic","_id":"870d0d9e-5988-4ad5-a4d4-8293d035a290","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.735Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.735Z"},"tagType":"country"}],"title":"FORPOL","internalLinks":[],"organisationMemberOf":[],"activity":[],"projectFunded":[{"name":"EA Infrastructure Fund","_id":"e41ccacf-4633-431e-8fb8-7727ab8d30ed","_owner":"89c27159-d0d6-4d08-bdc0-ea92984d69a8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-23T13:34:10.526Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-23T13:34:10.526Z"},"tagType":"project type"}],"organisationHasMember":[],"organisationPeople":[]},"_id":"06143814-203d-495e-8df3-00a01f6266b8"},{"dataCollectionId":"InfoPages","data":{"projectParticipantTeam":[{"name":"Norbert Kołos","_id":"18cd0331-9798-4cc1-9e33-8e6f2c2dbff6","_owner":"0ef176d6-d78e-4088-a491-5f45fe28ad7c","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-14T09:09:39.299Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-14T09:09:39.299Z"},"tagType":"person"}],"organisation":[],"organisationProject":[],"postImage2":{"url":" ","caption":""},"postContentRIch2":"<p></p>\n","methods":[{"name":"Survey","_id":"3886c659-e84d-44eb-96b9-21acc6d65a09","_owner":"89c27159-d0d6-4d08-bdc0-ea92984d69a8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T13:17:14.384Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T13:17:14.384Z"},"tagType":"foresight method"}],"pageTypes":[{"popularity":35,"name":"project info","_id":"fcb0cbbc-98a5-4743-8c8b-1cb1c8326a85","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:51:01.714Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:51:01.714Z"},"tagId":252527,"tagType":"page type"}],"projectCoordinator":[],"_id":"f9fd3498-672c-45ba-a9f8-053691e04385","_owner":"89c27159-d0d6-4d08-bdc0-ea92984d69a8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T13:17:28.273Z"},"organisationType":[],"postContentRIch3":"<p></p>\n","domains":[{"popularity":56,"name":"ethics","_id":"181c91b0-ed13-40a9-8c45-077c30a6b4ad","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:25.092Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:25.092Z"},"tagType":"domain"},{"popularity":68,"name":"fairness","_id":"bf9e79aa-543b-46cf-a108-9ceb46520d5e","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:25.090Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:25.090Z"},"tagType":"domain"},{"name":"Futures literacy","_id":"b99431d0-ed19-4f73-bc7c-fae45125034a","_owner":"89c27159-d0d6-4d08-bdc0-ea92984d69a8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T13:11:34.619Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T13:11:34.619Z"},"tagType":"domain"}],"personOrganisationFormer":[],"personProjectParticipation":[],"postImage1":{"url":"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/471908_71a5d4695fea470ca892be99492b290f~mv2.webp","caption":""},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-23T12:45:12.427Z"},"slug":"how-will-we-disgust-our-descendants-rvsft","mediaFiles":[{"displayName":"","url":"","fileName":"","thumbnail":"","sizeInBytes":"","type":""}],"Project":[{"name":"How will we disgust our descendants?","_id":"03d3bb0f-f469-47e6-8bf1-755ac9741ab7","_owner":"89c27159-d0d6-4d08-bdc0-ea92984d69a8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T13:03:53.047Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T13:17:31.947Z"},"tagType":"project","tagPageLink":"/project/how-will-we-disgust-our-descendants-rvsft"}],"projectOrganisationRoles":[{"organisation":"4CF The Futures Literacy Company ","role":"Coordinator"},{"organisation":"","role":""}],"projectOrganisation":[{"name":"4CF The Futures Literacy Company ","_id":"10a72944-404e-49a1-a60d-867cde630728","_owner":"89c27159-d0d6-4d08-bdc0-ea92984d69a8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-23T12:44:57.760Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-23T12:44:57.760Z"},"tagType":"organisation"}],"personProjectCoordonation":[],"person":[],"pageOwner":[],"personOrganisation":[],"postContentRIch1":"<p>It would be short-sighted to assume that we, as humanity, have reached such a level of maturity that our descendants will not find some aspects of our – apparently civilised – everyday life repulsive and sad. <br>So we asked 60 futurists from around the world: “<strong>What will we disgust our descendants with?</strong>”<br>Many of the submitted ideas are already present in public discourse and confirm areas in which we need to change.

This study's foresight scenarios suggest that digitalisation can catalyse transformation, aiding in coping with shocks, knowledge acquisition, community building, and system-related thinking. But at the same time, it can also reinforce inequalities and introduce rigidities. Therefore, digitalisation support should aim to create sustainable food systems and robust, connected, and prosperous rural areas and communities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A sound digital transition strategy should promote agricultural and rural resilience, green transition, digital citizenship for farmers and communities, and overall well-being. Digitalisation should uphold values like trust, equality, power, sovereignty, and care. Its execution should prioritise collaboration, accessibility, people-centric design, and circularity.

It can be used as a tool to create effective policy responses, including in technology and innovation policies, and to shape technological change. In this report we present six anticipatory and technology foresight methods that can contribute to anticipatory intelligence in terms of public funding of innovation: the Delphi survey, genius forecasting, technology roadmapping, large language models used in foresight, horizon scanning and scenario planning. Each chapter provides a brief overview of the method with case studies and recommendations.The insights from this report show that only by combining different anticipatory viewpoints and approaches to spotting, understanding and shaping emergent technologies, can public funders such as the European Innovation Council improve their proactive approaches to supporting ground-breaking technologies. In this way, they will help innovation ecosystems to develop.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n","methods":[{"popularity":47,"name":"horizon

Garden: Pioneering Policy Innovation through Speculative Design</strong></p>\n<p>At Futures Garden, we embark on a visionary journey to redefine policy-making for Europe's future. Our unique platform collaborates with leading futurists, innovative designers, and engaged EU citizens to envision a Europe enriched by diverse potential futures, each with its own opportunities and challenges. Our mission? To revolutionize policy creation by intertwining speculative design with creativity, empathy, and analytical insight. Our four-step approach ensures a comprehensive and impactful exploration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Horizon Scanning</strong>: We dive into cutting-edge ideas and emerging trends, identifying opportunities that could shape Europe's future.</li>\n<li><strong>Speculative Design</strong>: Our creative process transforms abstract concepts into tangible, thought-provoking scenarios, making future possibilities more accessible and engaging.</li>\n<li><strong>Citizen Engagement</strong>: We delve into the societal implications of these speculative scenarios, gathering diverse perspectives and insights from EU citizens.</li>\n<li><strong>Policy Reflection</strong>: The final step involves analyzing the potential impact of these innovative ideas on policy-making, ensuring that future EU policies are forward-thinking, inclusive, and impactful.<br></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Creating fictional artifacts through speculative design</strong><br></p>\n<p>Futures Garden aims at creating inspiring alternative future scenarios through the use of fictional future artifacts that invite to reflection and debate. The pilot project took place in 2023 and addressed two themes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>“Dealing with future selves”</strong> explores new ways of being, individually and collectively, examines new practices and technologies that enhance self-reflection and sharing of emotions, which help shape our choices in life and nurture a renewed sense of togetherness.</li>\n<li><strong>“Extending human perception to new scales”</strong> explores the richness of non-human intelligences, expanding our attention and appreciation for their unique sensory worlds, their “umwelt” – what they “feel” and how they “think”. In doing so it departs from the human-centric worldview towards a deeper understanding and celebration of life on Earth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The resulting fictional artifacts took the form of short, thought-provoking movies – <strong><em>Inwards</em></strong> and <strong><em>Symbiotic</em></strong> – which render the imagined future scenarios more tangible, immersive and engaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.futuresgarden.eu/artefacts/inwards\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Watch </strong><strong><em>\"Inwards\"</em></strong> </a> - <em>The 2050s a re a time of deep social reconfiguration. No longer believing in the myth of perpetual economic growth, recipes for self-empowerment, and technological fixes, citizens of Europe seek to regain agency by turning inwards.</em><br><em>New cultures of emotional excellence and material minimalism emerge, supported by tools for assisted introspection and emotion sharing. In the wake of this quiet revolution, the social contract progressively integrates a renewed sense of togetherness. </em><br><br><a href=\"https://www.futuresgarden.eu/artefacts/symbiotic\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Watch </strong><strong><em>\"Symbiotic</em></strong></a><strong><em>\"</em></strong>  - <em>Set in  the Symbiocene era of the 2050s, a time marked by an expanded understanding of intelligence beyond human confines, Symbiotic explores a revolutionary breakthrough.

This film documents the first groundbreaking experiences through the device, capturing the profound experiences of those who ventured into these new realms of

foresight study aimed at supporting the development of the Strategic Plan of Horizon Europe (2025-2027), by providing early-stage strategic intelligence and sense-making that could contribute novel elements to the processes of strategic planning.</p>\n<p>The study, which was launched in mid-2021 and lasted almost two years, has been the most widely engaging foresight exercise yet aiming to support EU R&amp;I policy. Through this broad engagement, the study did not only develop intelligence for the 2nd Strategic Plan of Horizon Europe but also contributed to the development of an EU R&amp;I foresight community hosted by futures4europe.eu, one that is an asset for future R&amp;I policies across Europe.</p>\n<p>The foresight process in support of the 2nd Strategic Plan comprised a wide spectrum of activities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As a reference point for the exploratory work, the explicit and implicit impact assumptions of the 1st Strategic Plan were identified and visualised with the help of a qualitative system analysis and modelling tool for causal loop analysis.<br><br></li>\n<li>An exploratory analysis of forward-looking sources (e.g. foresight reports, web-based horizon scanning) was conducted to identify relevant trends and signals of unexpected developments. These were discussed in online workshops and on the online platform futures4europe.eu.<br><br></li>\n<li>An outlook on emerging developments in the global and European context of EU R&amp;I policy was developed drawing on a major online workshop in autumn 2021 with some 60 participants, experts and policy makers, who worked with multi-level context scenarios and specific context narratives about emerging disruptions.<br><br></li>\n<li>On that basis and in close consultation with the European Commission involving another major workshop in February 2022 which brought together 80 participants, Expert Teams were set up to develop disruptive scenarios in five areas of major interest. Each team ran several internal workshops but also involved further experts and Commission staff in their work, both through the online platform and through a final policy-oriented workshop. The foresight work within the five areas of interest resulted in deep dives on the following topics:<br>&gt; <em>Climate change, Research, and Innovation: Radical Options from Social Change to Geoengineering</em><br>&gt; <em>Hydrogen Economy – A radical alternative</em><br>&gt; <em>The EU in a Volatile New World - The challenge of global leadership</em> <br>&gt; <em>Global Commons</em><br>&gt; <em>Transhumanist Revolutions</em><br><br></li>\n<li>Further areas of interest identified were explored through review papers aiming to capture major trends, developments and scenario sketches in relation to further disruptive developments:<br>    &gt; <em>Social Confrontations</em><br>    &gt; <em>Artificial General Intelligence: Issues and Opportunities</em><br>    &gt; <em>The Interpenetration of Criminal and Lawful Economic Activities </em><br>    &gt; <em>The Future of Health</em><br><br></li>\n<li>A third major workshop took place in October 2022 bringing together all the thematic strands of work and addressing possible R&amp;I policy implications from this work. Participation in this workshop reached 250 individuals over 2 days.<br><br></li>\n<li>Building on the workshop, the online Dynamic Argumentative Delphi survey Research4Futures collected suggestions from almost 950 contributors from Europe and beyond about the implications of this foresight work for the priorities of EU R&amp;I policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The detailed description of the foresight work and the resulting outputs are available in the final report of the project.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This foresight study has been implemented through the Foresight on Demand framework contract, by a team of 40 experts.
