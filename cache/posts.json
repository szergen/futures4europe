common ways of transmitting respiratory viruses. The reach of airborne pathogens and persistence of aerosolized particles suspended in the air are a significant concern for the spread of pandemic and seasonal respiratory diseases. This is particularly relevant in indoor spaces where most respiratory infections occur. Controlling the transmission of airborne pathogens is therefore a cornerstone of public health efforts to manage and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, ensuring safety and health for individuals and communities. Technologies that allow such control are essential to address the challenge.</p>\n<p><br>This report is the output of a comprehensive study which evaluates the potential of the current technology landscape for suppressing indoor airborne pathogen transmission.

anticipatory methodologies.<br>The workshop, held on 13 May 2024, had as its primary goal the evaluation and prioritisation of trends and signals on emerging technologies and breakthrough innovation, across all technolo-gy readiness levels (TRLs), within the EIC's Advanced Materials portfolio and with a particular fo-cus on their use in the Energy sector.</p>\n<p><br>Signals for the workshop were gathered from experts, literature review, and text/data mining of patents, publications, and EU-funded projects. These signals were then scrutinised for their sig-nificance to the field's future by a diverse group of sector experts which led to the identification of nine key topics: accelerated material design/synthesis; biomaterials as part of the circular economy; advanced materials allowing new applications; closed loop battery recycling; innova-tions in catalysis; organic batteries for sustainable energy storage; design to performance bat-teries; design to cost batteries; and electrochemical water treatment. Furthermore, the workshop identified additional wild cards with high novelty and disruptive potential such as: circularity of materials (safe and sustainable by design); membranes / separators; process optimisation; 3D printing of electrode materials for energy and environmental engineering applications; and use of AI for the study of materials.<br>Participants also highlighted various factors that could influence the development, adoption, and promotion of these emerging technologies, which can be grouped under the following categories: governance and compliance frameworks; funding; collaboration and knowledge exchange; sustainable and efficient development; infrastructure and technological advancement and limita-tions; industry and market dynamics and constraints; innovation and risk management; supply chain and raw materials; and talent development.</p>\n","projects":[{"name":"FUTURINNOV","_id":"5a19fea5-da86-4f30-a88a-ff990cf57fcd","_owner":"d3268e01-e2ba-455a-81c4-d86515cf97f8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-31T11:53:37.739Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-11-08T15:20:40.706Z"},"mentions":0,"tagType":"project","tagPageLink":"/project/futurinnov-c35sm"}],"countryTag":[{"name":"EU","_id":"e1b13728-5253-484b-92d6-0c451813adff","_owner":"89c27159-d0d6-4d08-bdc0-ea92984d69a8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T10:28:23.621Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T10:28:23.621Z"},"tagType":"country"}],"title":"Materialising

and narratives are a powerful tool of Futures Literacy and Futures Thinking.

Adding up to 21 stories, the narratives in this booklet deal with the planetary emergency, the existential threat of climate change and the biodiversity crisis, which are driving the European Green Deal. They were built on ideas by people from all around the world. Some were experts in the field, some purely engaged citizens with a story to tell. Stories from 2050 range from plausible sci-fi stories of the future to fictional fairy tales that provoke abstract thinking. Some stories are hopeful; others are concerning.

Finally, the initially envisaged impact of innovation on firms and countries; economic success has been significantly widened in its contribution to sustainable development.

It presents trends that are likely to shape the region's competitiveness until 2035. It examines the potential impact on inclusive growth and provides examples that could be useful for the economies of the Western Balkans (WB). Based on desk research, expert interviews and an online trends workshop, the DLR-PT's Foresight team prepared the study in March and April 2023. It provides stakeholders with evidence-based insights to prepare for future developments and help formulate effective policy options and strategies. The study focuses on four key areas defined by the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2020: the enabling environment, human capital, markets and the innovation ecosystem. Through desk research, qualitative interviews and expert workshops, it identifies trends that provide a comprehensive view of the likely evolution of competitiveness over the next 12 years, enabling policymakers to anticipate future challenges.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The study provides a methodological overview of Strategic Foresight and delves into the trends within the identified pillars, providing a summary of findings and recommendations for future action.

It is simultaneously instrumental to the green and digital transition and exposed to its effects. A steady supply of (green) chemicals is required to deploy renewable energy generators, insulate Europe’s building stock and create reusable and recyclable consumer goods. On the other hand, chemical synthesis is an energy-intensive process inherently dependent on carbon-based feedstock (currently derived almost exclusively from fossil fuels). In addition, chemistry is a global industry with international value chains, where the EU both collaborates and competes with other countries for materials, knowledge and skills. Transforming the European chemical industry into a sustainable motor for the green and digital transition will require investments in infrastructure, assets and skills. Focus should be placed on chemicals that are crucial to this Twin Transition, Europe’s resilience, or both. The long lead time required for the deployment of infrastructure and the development of skills means that such investments must be made now to achieve targets set for 2050. In connection with these issues, the report at hand aims to give insights into a number of value chains that are strategic to EU economy.

report documents the process and findings of a horizon scanning exercise, part of a series under the FUTURINNOV (FUTURe-oriented detection and assessment of emerging technologies and breakthrough INNOVation) project, a collaboration between the European Innovation Council (EIC) and the Joint Research Centre (JRC), aiming to bolster the EIC's strategic intelligence through foresight and anticipatory methodologies.</p>\n<p><br>The workshop, held on 24 April 2024, had as its primary goal the evaluation and prioritisation of trends and signals on emerging technologies and breakthrough innovation, across all technology readiness levels (TRLs) and within the EIC's Quantum technologies portfolio.</p>\n<p><br>Signals for the workshop were gathered from experts, literature review, and text/data mining of patents, publications, and EU-funded projects. These signals were then scrutinised for their significance to the field's future by a diverse group of sector experts which led to the identification of nine key topics: quantum sensing; quantum algorithms for lattice-based computational fluid dynamics models; materials for quantum; Artificial Intelligence for quantum; error correction; solid-state scalability; quantum for Artificial Intelligence; quantum as a service – metacloud; and quantum computers. Furthermore, the workshop identified additional wild cards with high novel-ty and disruptive potential such as quantum sensing AI on edge and molecular spin qubits.<br>Participants also highlighted various factors that could influence the development, adoption, and promotion of these emerging technologies, which can be grouped under the following categories: technical advancements; investment and infrastructure support; cross-sector collaboration; regulatory navigation; talent acquisition; market maturity; and application utility.</p>\n","projects":[{"name":"FUTURINNOV","_id":"5a19fea5-da86-4f30-a88a-ff990cf57fcd","_owner":"d3268e01-e2ba-455a-81c4-d86515cf97f8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-31T11:53:37.739Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-11-08T15:20:40.706Z"},"mentions":0,"tagType":"project","tagPageLink":"/project/futurinnov-c35sm"}],"countryTag":[{"name":"EU","_id":"e1b13728-5253-484b-92d6-0c451813adff","_owner":"89c27159-d0d6-4d08-bdc0-ea92984d69a8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T10:28:23.621Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T10:28:23.621Z"},"tagType":"country"}],"title":"\n(DIS)ENTANGLING THE FUTURE","projectResultMedia":{"url":"https://0bbe2e34-e503-441a-af9e-4fc70c17e6af.usrfiles.com/ugd/471908_0800e49a63354709aeed1c2dd546f74a.pdf","fileName":"(DIS)ENTANGLING THE FUTURE Horizon-scanning for emerging technologies and breakthrough innovations in the field of quantum technologies.pdf","thumbnail":"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/471908_e13449fe32c34fd7b3afa658531b2fa8~mv2.jpeg","sizeInBytes":"1124040","type":"document"},"internalLinks":[],"projectResultAuthor":[{"name":"Antonia Mochan","_id":"c3ab2ca6-655e-448b-b5e1-1f2f9fafa7a9","_owner":"0ef176d6-d78e-4088-a491-5f45fe28ad7c","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-14T09:09:39.077Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-14T09:09:39.077Z"},"tagType":"person"},{"name":"Joao Farinha","_id":"85737a3f-039a-438b-8ab9-d1b8f6cba4cf","_owner":"0ef176d6-d78e-4088-a491-5f45fe28ad7c","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-14T09:09:39.012Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-14T09:09:39.012Z"},"tagType":"person"},{"name":"Gwendolyn Bailey","_id":"c1ecb2f3-4ff0-4a64-9bb1-0fc1a766ca1a","_owner":"0ef176d6-d78e-4088-a491-5f45fe28ad7c","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-14T09:09:39.034Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-14T09:09:39.034Z"},"tagType":"person"},{"name":"Samira Nik","_id":"a6725e53-2a4f-4bcb-acd6-fe525831d651","_owner":"89c27159-d0d6-4d08-bdc0-ea92984d69a8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-11-08T16:27:06.056Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-11-08T16:27:06.056Z"},"tagType":"person"},{"name":"Alexandre Polvora","_id":"dcb9c12b-d1ad-4b4d-88be-86151a52cefa","_owner":"89c27159-d0d6-4d08-bdc0-ea92984d69a8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-28T10:09:08.316Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-28T10:09:08.316Z"},"tagType":"person"}]},"_id":"ebb7e1a8-ab7d-4988-90ef-89b9638b6c8b"},{"dataCollectionId":"PostPages","data":{"projectResultPublicationDate":"2024-05-31T21:00:00.000Z","subtitle":"Eyes on the Future -

Stories give humans a powerful evolutionary advantage that allows us to collaborate at scale by learning from the experiences or ideas of others. The stories we tell about the future influence and are influenced by others people’s views of the future. What is more, they can steer our own and our collective futures.<br><br>In this 90 minute workshop you will learn some of the basics of how we come to develop stories about the future in our own minds. You will understand better how these stories can have a big impact on the decisions that we make as individuals and collectively. Working in groups you will explore alternative future stories and together create a re-authored future narrative which will feed into #ourfutures project on the Futures4Europe platform. After the workshop, we would like to offer 30 minutes for an informal exchange to participants who would like to keep the conversation going after the official program ends. <br><br>Claire Marshall is an Australian doctoral researcher within Transdisciplinary School (TD School) at UTS.

These companies are heavily concen-trated in some parts of the world, most of them within the West Coast of the United States, with a few emerging challengers in Mainland China, Taiwan and elsewhere. Other continents, including Europe, participate marginally in the development of the knowledge-bases which, apparently, may well come to dominate the future. Societies have come to rely on Big Tech from how we do business to how we consume and connect with others. And decision-makers, regulators and stakeholders grapple with breakthrough innovations, enhanced connectivity, lopsided competition and a number of ethical and political implications for how societies govern themselves.<br><br>Organised societies face difficult choices. Should Big Tech be let free to carry on unimpeded? Should government break them up or try to tame them by imposing detailed standards of conduct?

We derive <strong>policy options</strong> for each scenario but also draw cross-cut-ting implications. Could tech-driven large companies be instruments for the European Union (EU) to respond effectively to the challenges of the future economy? Is this a viable, feasible option? Conversely, have foreign-owned Big Tech already won and will the EU be hostage to the tentacles of such sprawling giants? Can it adapt through bottom-up economic action?

Even though natural dynamics also have a substantial effect on climate, there is no doubt that current alterations of climate with the correlated impacts are manmade. Alongside continuing efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change, there may be possibilities to geoengineer climate systems to reduce or mask the impacts of climate change. There are also strong arguments for large-scale changes in social practices for adapting to and mitigating climate change. The big challenge comes with the necessary scale of interventions as those changes need to be large-scale and global, putting new challenges to all levels of governance from local to global.</p>\n<p>Many present drivers seem to indicate a gloomy future for the climate. The current individualistic mindsets drive overconsumption and overproduction. The offsetting of carbon emissions is sometimes used to compensate for dirty activities. Intense competition for natural resources is not safeguarding their sustainability. Bio-holistic worldviews confront anthropocentric views, but climate delay has emerged as the new denial and the lack of courage to address climate supremacists, i.e. the global wealthy, shows little change of direction. According to a 2020 report from Oxfam and the Stockholm Environment Institute, the wealthiest top 1% were responsible for 15% of global emissions, nearly twice as much as the world’s poorest 50%, who were responsible for just 7%. Overly optimistic beliefs in tech or social transformation to solve it prevail, and there is a wide reluctance to consider broad system change.</p>\n<p>There are also drivers towards desired futures. Improved understanding of climate and global change and the capacity and knowledge to purposefully shape nature and society provide better means to address climate change. Climate anxiety and perception of government inaction have triggered, for instance, the ‘Fridays for future’ movement, which contributes to the emergence of global conscience on the climate and biodiversity crisis and the need for justice. New understandings of human purpose and fairness also encourage the development of a wider range of responses like de-desertification, seaweed permaculture, ocean fertilization, carbon capture and storage, and solar radiation management. We may learn to protect the global commons, including indigenous cultures and atmospheric commons.</p>\n<p>Economic growth in societies based on individual material gain, here-and-now-thinking, short political cycles, and lack of broad political agreement on alternative paths seem to keep us on the path to the climate crisis. Furthermore, exacerbated social inequalities may lead many to have no willingness or ability to participate in transitions. While we are overconfident with systems’ design, we underestimate natural forces and ecosystems. Emerging options for large-scale ‘geoengineering’ interventions in the climate system promise new opportunities and new risks, including novel geopolitical tensions.There are diverse perceptions on geoengineering and possible social change towards potential acceptance or societal rejection. The planet lacks a fair and appropriate governance structure providing a framework on who might be entitled to carry out geoengineering projects in the name of the planet and what their responsibility is. There is no sufficient dialogue on what it means to be a responsible company, researcher, research organisation, or policy-maker in this context.</p>\n<p>This deep dive is part of the Foresight

outer space, and cyberspace. Given the growing significance of these domains and related resources for states and other global and local players across a range of purposes, defining the concept of the global commons has become more complex. The Global Commons Alliance network of concerned organisations refers to two definitions of the concept.</p>\n<p><br>The first is based on geopolitics, where the global commons are areas whose potential economic resources lie beyond national jurisdiction: the atmosphere, the high seas, Antarctica, and outer space. The second definition has its roots more in economics and how shared resources can be overused by some at the expense of others, regardless of national jurisdiction. The strategic access and use of resource domains for military/commercial purposes put pressure on their status. Recent geopolitical developments highlight the need for exploring appropriate forms of global governance or stewardship to ensure responsible (sustainable) management to benefit present and future generations.</p>\n<p>This deep dive aims to address the following questions:<br></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What constitutes a global commons?</strong> How do global commons differ? How is the concept of global commons likely to evolve up to 2040? Adapting a taxonomy of global commons for the emerging geopolitical, environmental, and economic context.</li>\n<li><strong>What are the main emerging disruptors of global commons up to 2040?</strong> What could change and upset established global commons regimes? How can laws be introduced and implemented in emerging global commons? The emphasis is on geopolitics and how legal frameworks can survive technological change. How can innovation reinforce the commons?</li>\n<li><strong>How is the economics of common property evolving </strong>(from Hardin's very influential work to the massive critique of Hardin by Elinor Ostrom)? linking to major policy debates such as privatisation. Can Ostrom’s approach be scaled up to the level of states? and extended to the common property of the atmosphere or oceans? What would be necessary for such a large-scale negotiation process?</li>\n<li><strong>How can we govern the commons as a different type of ownership?</strong> The emergence of global commons-orientation in innovation? In particular mission-oriented innovation. Exploring the rights and personality of ecosystems and other entities as right holders. Ecological services as transversal.</li>\n<li><strong>How can we make the global commons work?</strong> - the need for cooperative behaviour if global commons and sustainability are to be achieved. Multilateralism 2.0. and emerging role of science diplomacy up to 2040.  Ukraine war as an epochal war: the dangers of the war (state of permanent cold war) for acting seriously on the global commons.

the features of societies are fundamentally transformed by technology. Even though scenarios are built along the lines of particular scientific and/or technological advancements, the discussion spreads over sociotechnical ensembles and the re-conceptualization of the relationship between technology and society by 2040.</p>\n<p><br>The work leading to this report started with a horizon scanning exercise to identify a series of technological innovations and scientific breakthroughs that may be considered key factors towards re-engineering human nature. In parallel, the authors explored diverse narratives regarding the human condition and significance in the world, dreams and fears embodied in the so-called collective imaginary, echoing through myths and fantasies to literature, cinematography and the wider culture. At the intersection of these explorations, twelve topics were selected and further expanded into scenarios. They are not intended to cover the full spectrum of themes regarding human enhancement, but present a relevant ‘sample’ of potential future trajectories.</p>\n<p><br>We propose these narratives as<strong> exploratory scenarios</strong>, describing futures where both positive and negative consequences are palpable. They are not normative, outlininga vision of the future deemed desirable. We invite readers to regard them as devices for imagining the future and debating the future. They aim to nurture a reflection on the dynamics of change, future opportunities and potential threats, and in doing so they contribute to future preparedness.</p>\n<p><br>Three types of scenarios were developed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first type describe futures where scientific and technological advancements <strong>enhance embodied experiences</strong>: <em>Sensory augmentation</em>:  extending human senses beyond the natural limits and adding sensorial modalities which are not native to humans. <em>Sensory and brain stimulation, psychedelic microdosin</em>g: inducing altered states of consciousness, for healing purposes or for fostering new perspectives on being human. <em>Molecular therapies for delaying aging</em>; and <em>new artificial reproductive technologies </em>allowing people to be fertile until much older age.</li>\n<li>The second type explore futures where human capabilities are <strong>extended by embodying non-biological means</strong>: a significant share of elderly people using <em>exoskeletons</em> for prolonging active life, for maintaining their mobility or as a form of assisted living; <em> brain-computer interfaces</em> leveraged in semi-automatized work environments, to improve learning outcomes, and to control smart devices;  <em>Brain to brain communication</em> supporting cognitive and emotion sharing, leading to the creation of ‘hive minds’ covering multiple aspects of life.</li>\n<li>The third type focus on the <strong>simulation and replication of the human body and mind</strong>:<em> Digital body twins</em> allowing alert signals for disease prevention and the simulation of the short- and long-term effects of a person’s behavior on their health and body; <em>Digital twins of the brain</em> allowing testing hypotheses in cognitive science, in mental health studies, responses to different types of treatments;  <em>Digital immersive worlds</em> – gaming/ fantasy worlds or ‘mirror worlds’ that are replicating real-life environments – hosting interactions among people and automated entities;  <em>Digital replicas of the deceased</em> changing the socio-political understanding of grief; and <em>Artificial agents</em> with complex underlying computational procedures (including e.g. self-reflection, development of value system, affective computing) and sophisticated interfaces calling for new theoretical frameworks of consciousness.<br><br><br>***<br>The twelve scenarios presented in this deep dive are part of the Foresight towards the 2nd Strategic Plan of Horizon Europe project, which was conducted by

For example, we have extensively used the Scenario Exploration System (SES) in various projects, as a tool for communicating scenarios and for developing ideas for strategies. This is why we were excited to participate in the #OurFutures initiative, which offers people the opportunity to freely express their images of the future, their fears, hopes or anxieties.  <br><br>In most foresight projects we tend to collect the views and the future images of a rather small group of experts. The questionnaires used in these exercises are usually based on a specific set of questions and define a specific agenda of topics of interest. On the contrary, #OurFutures helps to 'decolonise' the future, offering  participants the opportunity to select any topic of interest, both local and global - while also allowing them to self-evaluate their stories. <br><br>What is interesting with Greece is that most of the focus has and is being laid on the present and the past, but there are practically no studies exploring society’s views for the long-term future - this is why I like the #OurFutures project, which provides both the structure and the content for initiating a conversation among groups of participants.<br><br>We therefore decided to fully support the initiative, to use it in all our workshops and public events, and also to utilise the collected information in parallel with other studies we have been running in Greece, like Innovation 2040.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What key findings you were you able to draw from the stories #OurFutures collected so far from Greek participants?<br></strong> <br><em>Vivian Efthimiopoulou (VE)</em>: During these first months of the project, we have collected extremely interesting data on which we can base our further research, but we have already identified some telling insights.   <br><br>It was interesting to see that the future images are shaped mainly by personal experiences and social media. It comes as no surprise that younger people (18-25 year olds) believe that it is mainly their personal experiences which shape their future image. But as people get older, they probably learn to recognise most of the factors that shape their perception of the world, their future as well as their past.<br><br>Another important and optimistic, if I may say, finding is that the vast majority of respondents feel empowered to bring change. Especially after Greece's difficult past two decades, many of the participants were able to think not only positively, but also beyond their own county, imagining stories with a global interest.<br><br>Perhaps one of the main takeaways from this project is that most participants in the project believe that the responsibility for making change happen falls on politicians, businesspeople and scientists. Therefore, political and financial leadership is necessary for a better future: from where we can extrapolate a very positive element of this exercise, namely the belief and trust in public institutions, but who need to step up in the face of current crises.</p>\n<p><strong>As Chief Scientific Advisor on Strategic Foresight for the Presidency of the Greek Government, what policy-relevant insights can you draw? Why is the #OurFutures initiative valuable for policymakers and policymaking? <br></strong><br>EC: Greeks are very proud about their past. Even the recent, difficult periods of modern Greek history are present in a constant passionate and heated public discourse. <br><br>In this context, it came as a surprise for many - although not for us - to see that the #OurFutures survey generated such interest. This entire process has been extremely useful to demonstrate an alternative way to communicate and listen to what broader society has to say. <br><br>Another important finding, which can come in handy to any government, are the topics of interest that emerged and that are quite different from the ones usually brought up in the mainstream media. One example that springs to mind is migration: although Greece is on the eastern border of the EU and one of the main points of entry into Europe for a lot of migrants, migration scored very low as an issue for many respondents.<br><br>Another noteworthy takeaway is that most participants are very concerned about the future, underlining the need for politicians across the political spectrum to start addressing the serious environment challenges, societal imbalances and the impacts of technology. It also becomes clear that education systems need to invest more in the study of the future(s), not only of the past and to integrate futures literacy, in parallel with other soft skills, from primary and secondary education onwards.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>***<br><strong>Epaminondas Christophilopoulos</strong> <br>Epaminondas holds the UNESCO Chair on Futures Research at FORTH, he is Chief Scientific Advisor to the Special Secretariat for Foresight, at the Presidency of the Government, and President of the Metropolitan Organization of Visual Arts of Thessaloniki (MOMus). <br><br><strong>Vivian Efthimiopoulou</strong> <br>Vivian is an Athens-based communication expert working actively with clients across private sector industries and institutions on strategic planning and crisis management.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>This post was originally published on 15 May 2023 on <a href=\"https://policy-lab.ec.europa.eu/news/future-europe-futures-imagined-greek-citizens-2023-05-15_en\" target=\"_blank\">policy-lab.ec.europa.eu</a>&nbsp;</p>\n","methods":[],"pageTypes":[{"popularity":253,"name":"post","_id":"cc31afc1-a304-465a-be3e-a887b68884f3","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:51:01.713Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:51:01.713Z"},"tagId":252528,"tagType":"page type"}],"_id":"d2dcdccf-2245-4d4d-83e2-001d5bd4fc66","_owner":"f677c1bb-4334-4039-a211-fdd89e013a3c","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-24T18:46:06.329Z"},"postContentRIch3":"<p></p>\n","domains":[{"popularity":52,"name":"citizen engagement","_id":"3e20987c-c439-4214-bfff-515f49d8a65f","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:25.111Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:25.111Z"},"tagType":"domain"}],"postImage1":{"url":"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/471908_85b98d46d5124d899df7bae440ae9802~mv2.png","caption":""},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-30T11:24:34.488Z"},"slug":"the-future-of-europe-futures-imagined-by-greek-citizens-bufnm","mediaFiles":[{"displayName":"","url":"","fileName":"","thumbnail":"","sizeInBytes":"","type":""}],"moderators":[],"pageOwner":[],"speakers":[],"organisations":[{"popularity":50,"name":"Joint Research Center","_id":"f85b3c01-69e8-4688-8766-14c3910bea1b","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.871Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.871Z"},"tagType":"organisation"}],"postContentRIch1":"<p>What will Europe look like in 2040?

and guiding policy decisions.<br><br>The online MLE brought together <strong>fifty participants</strong> from diverse stakeholder groups: Eye of Europe partner organizations, the European Commission, R&amp;I funding agencies, representatives of governmental bodies. The event, organized by Technology Centre Prague (TC), focused on the topic of policy oriented communication of foresight results. Group and plenary discussions in three interactive sessions were framed by expert presentations showcasing diverse practices in the application and communication of foresight.<br><br>Presentations:<br></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Michal Pazour</strong> (TC Prague, Czech Republic) introduced the Eye of Europe project and the context of this second Mutual Learning Event.</li>\n<li>Moderator of the event <strong>Lenka Hebáková</strong> (TC Prague, Czech Republic) followed up with an introduction to the event’s aims and agenda.</li>\n<li><strong>Mikko Dufva</strong> (SITRA, Finland) – “Communicating foresight. From knowing it all to empowering change”. The presentation included three case studies: SITRA’s decade long experience with megatrends as a platform for dialogue, their work on weak signals as an invitation to broaden futures thinking in a “what if?” spirit and, finally, their efforts to empower others to define futures bottom-up, through small funding to diverse teams across Finland.</li>\n<li>“Communicating foresight in the European Commission” presented by <strong>Maia Knutti</strong> and <strong>Teodora Garbovan</strong> (EU Policy Lab, European Commission) brought insights into how, in the European Commission context, foresight is employed and linked with the policy cycle. Examples covered foresight content (e.g. Strategic Foresight Reports) and engagement tools (e.g. megatrends hub, scenario exploration system) that are serving different stakeholder groups across multiple channels.</li>\n<li><strong>Bianca Dragomir</strong> (Institutul de Prospectiva, Romania) discussed a case study on embedding foresight into policy making in the context of developing the Strategy for Fishing and Aquaculture 2035 in Romania. Moreover, she shared about embedding foresight into both policy making and societal conversation, discussing two Foresight on Demand projects: Scenarios on “Transhumanist Revolutions” and foresight-meets-speculative-design project “Futures Garden”.</li>\n<li><strong>Totti Könnölä</strong> (Insight Foresight Institute, Spain) shared about the Foresight on Demand project \"European R&amp;I foresight and public engagement for Horizon Europe\" that advanced several objectives: generating foresight intelligence, i.e. through forward-looking policy briefs; monitoring of foresight activities and providing support for exploitation (Horizon Futures Watch); laying the building blocks for a European foresight community supported by an online platform.</li>\n<li><strong>Marie Ségur</strong> (Futuribles, France) presented a case study on “Future of social work in France to 2035-2050” and the methods employed throughout the process: using surveys to motivate engagement with futures thinking, scenario building that may inform strategic choices and guide towards a vision and, finally, communicating outcomes in a synthetic manner, that may contribute to a wider discussion around the topic.</li>\n<li>Eye of Europe project coordinator <strong>Radu Gheorghiu</strong> (UEFISCDI, Romania) shared previews of the upcoming upgrade of the futures4europe.eu platform, with its new look and extended features.<br><br><br><br><em>This event is the second in a series of five MLEs planned in the project; the following event will be held in January 2025 also in an online format.

Eye of Europe (EoE) project has reached an important milestone: Using an interactive approach,  the members of the consortium came up with eleven exciting topics that will be addressed in Foresight Workshops with experts, citizens, entrepreneurs, scientists, policymakers, journalists and many other stakeholder groups within the coming 16 months. In the workshops, Eye of Europe partners will apply both established and novel Foresight approaches to dive deep into topics of common interest to stakeholders across the European Research Area. These workshops will take place in cities such as Madrid, Prague, Berlin, Bucharest, Paris and Thessaloniki, as well as online. <br><br>The final set of topics for EoE pilot workshops is as follows:<br></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Democracy – a long term Project</strong>: This online workshop will gather domain experts to shed light on a large spectrum of future challenges to democracy.</li>\n<li><strong>The Knowledge of our Civilisation(s) in 2040</strong>: In this two-day Berlin based workshop participants with diverse domain expertise will explore the future of knowledge in human civilisation in the face of multiple drivers of change.</li>\n<li><strong>European Industrial Decarbonisation</strong>: This two-day workshop in Madrid will gather diverse stakeholders to debate alternative pathways of industrial decarbonisation for Europe in the face of different geopolitical scenarios.</li>\n<li><strong>Emotion Ecosystems</strong>: This Bucharest based two-day workshop will investigate the impact of technologies like affective computing and brain-machine interface on individuals and collectives with different stakeholder groups.</li>\n<li><strong>Democracy and Technology</strong>: In this workshop citizens in Prague will jointly reflect on democratic approaches to risks connected with new technologies and their impacts on various societal groups.</li>\n<li><strong>Aging and Assisted Living Technologies</strong>: This workshop in Berlin with international research and policy actors is dedicated to future ways of integrating smart and digital technologies into assisted living and care for older adults.</li>\n<li><strong>Fashion Futures</strong>: In two Thessaloniki based workshops citizens and domain experts will explore the future of sustainable fashion in interaction with values and identities both with a regional and international perspective.</li>\n<li><strong>Public Policy and Change of Diets</strong>: In this workshop in Paris a diverse group of citizens will reflect on policy inroads into future pathways towards healthy and sustainable diets.</li>\n<li><strong>Science and Conflicts</strong>: In this online workshop, experts and actors of the science system will jointly dive into possible implications of growing geopolitical tensions for science.</li>\n<li><strong>Future of Knowledge and Emotions</strong>: This futures survey will provide input for the two interrelated topics the future of knowledge and the future of emotion ecosystems that will feed the respective workshops.<br><br><br>These Eye of Europe Foresight pilot workshops have a twofold purpose.<br><br>First of all, the workshops serve the project’s aspirations expressed by Eye of Europe coordinator, Radu Gheorghiu, namely to  nurture the “vibrant community of individuals engaging in a conversation about our collective future” and to fuel the “continuous loop of dialogue, learning and inspiration”.<br><br>Secondly, by addressing topics of common interest to R&amp;I actors across ERA and major R&amp;I challenges, they aim to mobilise collective anticipatory intelligence. In particular, we hope to shed light on the evolution of research and innovation and its contribution to a wide range of important future questions.<br><br>How did the team arrive at these topics?<br><br>The topic generation process involved three major elements:<br></li>\n<li>Analysis of R&amp;I strategy documents from a range of different EU countries</li>\n<li>interviews with R&amp;I actors from different positions in ERA’s research and innovation ecosystem,</li>\n<li>and interactive discourse among EoE partner organisations.<br><br>It was important to the topic identification team, led by Pier Francesco Moretti from CNR - Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche in Italy, not to remain at the surface of the challenges that are expressed in key documents but to dive deeper into underlying root causes and dynamics. So when in the document analysis, topics like energy, artificial intelligence, digitalisation, health and security emerged at top positions, we strived to identify crosscutting underlying aspects.</li>\n</ul>\n","projects":[{"popularity":1,"name":"Eye of Europe","_id":"a3da923c-66d3-46a7-8ab0-8d33424f3b80","_owner":"144948d0-9596-4eda-8135-9a6fec9d1330","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-15T11:02:13.126Z"},"tagLine":"The Research and Innovation Foresight Community","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-25T11:17:57.445Z"},"picture":"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/471908_3fc30f50bb3c467aa3213c444816d649~mv2.png","tagType":"project","tagPageLink":"/project/Eye_of_Europe_6ft5d"}],"countryTag":[{"name":"EU","_id":"e1b13728-5253-484b-92d6-0c451813adff","_owner":"89c27159-d0d6-4d08-bdc0-ea92984d69a8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T10:28:23.621Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T10:28:23.621Z"},"tagType":"country"}],"title":"Eye of Europe Foresight Pilot Topics","projectResultMedia":{"url":"https://0bbe2e34-e503-441a-af9e-4fc70c17e6af.usrfiles.com/ugd/471908_f3488e3f37e247b8b590089e8a304ed3.pdf","fileName":"Eye of Europe Foresight Pilot Topics.pdf","thumbnail":"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/471908_23626597bccf4f66bb49a9741c6d6cc2~mv2.jpeg","sizeInBytes":"1709991","type":"document"},"internalLinks":[],"projectResultAuthor":[{"name":"Philine Warnke","_id":"26c009a4-0699-45fa-8d60-16ebfe63cd90","_owner":"0ef176d6-d78e-4088-a491-5f45fe28ad7c","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-14T09:09:38.978Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-14T09:09:38.978Z"},"tagType":"person"}]},"_id":"5733cea0-3205-4f9b-9981-29a3a5ef1185"},{"dataCollectionId":"PostPages","data":{"projectResultPublicationDate":null,"subtitle":"A Technology Foresight study","author":[{"name":"Angela Cristina Plescan","_id":"d5357589-65fd-456f-a506-7a4d1275451c","_owner":"0ef176d6-d78e-4088-a491-5f45fe28ad7c","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-14T09:09:39.143Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-11-09T23:33:52.822Z"},"mentions":12,"tagType":"person","tagPageLink":"/person/cristina-plescan-08n2a"}],"people":[],"postContentRIch2":"<p></p>\n","methods":[{"popularity":36,"name":"scenarios","_id":"3c4917d4-7467-4fef-a6a3-af7b61b9e196","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.946Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.946Z"},"tagType":"foresight method"}],"pageTypes":[{"popularity":126,"name":"project result","_id":"649a0649-abfd-43c3-86d5-2765c99f7f31","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:51:01.712Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:51:01.712Z"},"tagId":252529,"tagType":"page type"}],"_id":"f611dbc2-6c33-4ca8-b05c-c13e91a1e0f5","_owner":"89c27159-d0d6-4d08-bdc0-ea92984d69a8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T10:44:17.982Z"},"domains":[{"name":"Emerging Technologies","_id":"414e11bd-1c1c-4d88-b63e-f24a3b2c711a","_owner":"89c27159-d0d6-4d08-bdc0-ea92984d69a8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T10:37:07.120Z"},"tagLine":"","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-22T10:37:07.120Z"},"tagType":"domain"},{"popularity":14,"name":"health","_id":"255f22bd-fa84-4b93-a1f3-df2944b48ffa","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:25.084Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:25.084Z"},"tagType":"domain"}],"postImage1":{"url":" ","caption":""},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-28T12:47:26.088Z"},"slug":"suppressing-indoor-pathogen-transmission-1tkhp","mediaFiles":[{"displayName":"Suppressing indoor pathogen transmission","url":"https://0bbe2e34-e503-441a-af9e-4fc70c17e6af.usrfiles.com/ugd/471908_ff9170de02464a88a11e0c9f849758dc.pdf","fileName":"Suppressing indoor pathogen transmission_A Technology Foresight study.pdf","thumbnail":"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/471908_989b11b1fa8044088b8072b3623dfded~mv2.jpeg","sizeInBytes":"3179797","type":"document"},{"displayName":"","url":"","fileName":"","thumbnail":"","sizeInBytes":"","type":""}],"moderators":[],"pageOwner":[],"speakers":[],"organisations":[{"popularity":50,"name":"Joint Research Center","_id":"f85b3c01-69e8-4688-8766-14c3910bea1b","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.871Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.871Z"},"tagType":"organisation"},{"name":"HERA","_id":"4aa3fb83-c1ff-4368-8f7f-fb231687623c","_owner":"89c27159-d0d6-4d08-bdc0-ea92984d69a8","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-28T12:47:03.986Z"},"tagLine":"Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority","_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-28T12:47:03.986Z"},"tagType":"organisation"}],"postContentRIch1":"<p>Airborne transmission is considered one of the most common ways of transmitting respiratory viruses.

You might be a curious individual, researcher, entrepreneur or policymaker: all contribute to shape the future.</p>\n<p><strong>High hopes and high concerns for the future of our planet </strong><br>The overwhelming majority of the participants are hopeful and inspired by the future images they shared, and positive feelings are mostly associated to stories about nature, fairness and well-being. Interestingly enough, these topics are also leading the minority of less positive stories. <br><br>More than 40% of the participants talk about climate and nature issues. They imagine greener cities and a circular economy, show attention to the need to preserve biodiversity, to pursue more sustainable mobility etc. When people talk about caring for each other or health issues, they very often give it an environmental flavour: our health depends on the health of planet Earth and the need to protect it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>“Seventeen years from now, I would like the world to be […] a place where everything is in balance, especially the climate. Seventeen years from now I would like to see diesel or petrol cars abolished, factory emissions reduced and nature and greenery allowed to enter cities more efficiently. I would like the pavements to be cultivated, so as to support 0-impact mobility, and I would also like all houses to have an A grade or higher, so as to preserve the environment.” </em></p>\n<p>Participants do not believe that their future will happen by itself. It will take strengthening human connections, relationships, communication and empathy. In addition, the need for a stronger connection with nature and with the local context emerge from the stories. <br><br>Even though their images are mostly positive, respondents are quite concerned about the future. They show a rather pessimistic view of our ability to tackle climate-related and other environmental challenges: often the future they describe is seen as only possible in a utopian world. They especially express concern, powerlessness and fear when their stories are less about the future and more about a depiction of our current times.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>“The golden age is over. With inevitable climate change a centuries long age of decline has begun.” ”There is essentially no hope for our future on this planet.” </em></p>\n<p>Generally, though, the younger generation shares optimistic stories about the environment and the future of the planet, and believe that their perception will happen. Their images talk about de-growth, sustainable lifestyles, less individualism and more attention to the relationships among communities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>“One of the most important changes I would like to see in the future has to do with our energy consumption and production. It is vital that we switch to renewable sources of energy soon, as it is severely harmful to the environment.”  </em></p>\n<p>However, they seem to believe less in their own ability to shape that future in comparison to other age groups.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Social issues: what is included and what is absent in the stories?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Social dimensions are very much present in the images of the respondents - especially in those shared by women. Many stories mention a strong wish for a world without any discrimination based on gender, colour, and sexual orientation, and a fair Europe in which everyone has access to the same opportunities regardless of their background.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>“I wish that minorities will no longer be singled out, but that it will become normal for them to have respectable positions in society.” </em></p>\n<p>The strong focus on zero discrimination, social justice and solidarity, is also present in the few future images related to migration. Only 6% of the people connect their story to ‘migration’, and in those few stories that do talk about refugees, the topic is generally taken up from a positive stand: a plea for open borders, the need to care for migrants, and the wish to fully include them in the socio-economic space.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>“In my vision of an ideal 2040, freedom of movement should be open to all - not a headache for those who need to flee or a utopia for those who cannot afford it.” </em></p>\n<p><em>“Climate refugees will be welcomed and integrated in the villages and co-living projects.”  </em></p>\n<p>An overall desire for more economic well-being for everyone is common in stories related to the economy, and ‘work’ doesn’t seem to be top of mind when thinking about the future: very few people (only 8%) tagged their stories as related to ‘work/occupation’. This might also have to do with the fact that financially insecure, unemployed (and retired) people are at the moment underrepresented in this exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Politicians, business people and citizens together can make a better future happen – but citizens see themselves acting first </strong><br>The future is shaped by today’s actions. But who are the people that need to act to realise these desirable futures?  <br><br>The majority of contributors feel that government leaders, business people, scientists and citizens will need to work together to make the change happen. A clear trend, however, shows how important citizens or citizen groups are as changemakers. This pattern remains the same no matter what age group. Consequently, people feel that their own role in creating their future is quite substantial. Especially people that connect a positive feeling to their story believe in their ability to co-create their imagined future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>“Surrounded with a community of people who have positive attitude to make the society better. Be a conscious global citizen and sustainable life style (SDGS#12), intergenerational community, less spiritual-material divide, simple life style” </em></p>\n<p><strong>Strong belief in technology and science </strong><br>For people that are confident about the achievability of their future, technology plays a crucial role. Science and technology will help to find solutions to the major challenges of our world: it will enable economic well-being and high-quality life for everyone while protecting the environment. It will solve current challenges or strengthen new pathways in different sectors (communication, transport, employment, medicine, etc.). <br><br>Technology enjoys a very positive and optimistic flavour, especially when it comes to healthcare (Covid-19 was still very much present at the start of the story collection): it can enable more advanced surgeries and treatments for incurable diseases, further increasing life expectancy. <br><br>Reading the stories in which ‘business people &amp; scientists’ were seen as crucial to making that future happen, digitisation at all levels is the top topic. There seems to be a big hope in a high-tech future, ranging from technologies that attempt to divert climate change to the complete digitisation of our society, in which robots replace almost everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>“I see a future where people live in two domains, the physical and the metaverse. The metaverse will have much more relevance in the future. In some occasions, it will have prevalence regarding the physical world. The interplay between AI, Virtual Reality, Metaverse, Augmented reality will bring a new dimension in human life, even in longevity. Regarding the longevity, some of us will life as an avatar in a metaverse enabled by several companies that provide that service.” </em>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some other stories describe how technology will affect daily life.</p>\n<p><em>“Superfast internet will make it possible to visit other countries staying at home in virtual reality.”  </em></p>\n<p><em>“With the development of technology, many things have changed in our lives. People are now lazier because of this. They are lazier to do things and this affects the life of the whole world.”</em>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The increased presence of technology in our lives is seen as a negative evolution only in a few stories. Single cases describe how applications might take control over our societies and evolve towards a totalitarian state.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The relevance of local communities</strong> <br>The majority of respondents (more than 60%) consider their future images influenced by worldwide challenges, while European issues play a role in every sixth contribution. This corresponds with the high focus on climate change and global justice reflected in the stories, and, as the word ‘war’ is present in 49 stories, undoubtedly the war in Ukraine also influenced people's future thinking.  <br><br>National and local challenges each are considered to influence the future image only in every tenth story; however, community action at the local level is seen as the key driver to actively shape the future in nearly one third of the stories.   <br><br>Contributors see a significant role for themselves in strengthening human connections, creating better relationships in their neighbourhoods, or call for more empathy towards those who are seen as ‘different’ (in terms of ethnic background, gender, etc.).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>“I would like to see as many people as possible volunteering to help individuals in their community. E.g. helping the elderly and the disabled with grocery deliveries, transport. Helping children to learn, volunteering in schools to help with sports and other activities organised by the school, etc.”  </em></p>\n<p>A closer connection with nature is also reflected in local stories: from the need to change personal behaviours, to changes surroundings as through urban planning. <br><br>A small but still substantial number of stories talks about young people’s very personal concerns related to housing, finding a job, and having a pension.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>“It's no secret that the younger generation has been dealt a tough hand.”  </em></p>\n<p><em>“In the future, I would like everyone to be able to live in as little deprivation as possible; or for young people to be able to live as normally as possible; or to make the transition from adolescence to adulthood without major deprivation. By this I mean, above all, making it easier to become independent or to start life on one's own, where the housing would be reasonably priced or the rent would not be too high, and would enable the individual to live more easily and save money.” </em></p>\n<p><strong>General concern without losing hope? </strong><br>Although 70% of the people associate the image of their future with only positive feelings, people are clearly concerned about the future: 50% of the respondents have indicated high levels of concern.  <br><br>Still, their concern is not hopeless: a lot seems to be possible at local level if people act together, with technology as an ally.  <br><br>In the perspective offered by the stories collected, the challenge for decision makers and for policy makers becomes to enable a collaborative exchange among businesses, policymakers and citizens. Their combined efforts are in fact crucial to enable the overwhelming majority of positive societal and environmental scenarios shared in this exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><em>#OurFutures is an </em><a href=\"https://ourfutures.dashboard.voicesthatcount.net/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>open-data base</em></a><em>, designed by  the </em><a href=\"https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/foresight_en\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Competence Centre of Foresight</em></a><em>  of the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, to inspire a collective dialogue about the future of Europe.</em></p>\n<p><em>The first Futures Stories (591) were collected from 1 June 2021 till 30 May 2022 (start-up phase of the project).

Interviews with renowned national foresight experts complement the findings. Similar response rates from government and academia, business and other organisations such as consultancies or NGOs allowed for a diverse snapshot of R&amp;I foresight approaches in Europe.</p>\n<p><strong>Highlighting flagship projects</strong></p>\n<p>For the preparation of the study, European foresight actors submitted 54 different R&amp;I foresight projects. These include projects that aim to anticipate technological and societal changes in order to inform national and regional R&amp;I strategies and make them more robust, or foresight projects that address complex global issues such as climate change, cancer or sustainable food security. Others seek to understand new developments, such as the digital transformation, and analyse the social and economic impact of these changes, or to develop and design new products.</p>\n<p>R&amp;I foresight projects are not only carried out at European and national level. The report additionally highlights sub-national champions such as the Friuli Venezia Giulia region and Sardinia in Italy, the Helsinki-Uusimaa region in Finland, Ostbelgien and the Flemish government in Belgium, or Hauts-de-France, to show how they have used foresight methods to advance their R&amp;I agendas.</p>\n<p><strong>What are critical success factors and bottlenecks for R&amp;I foresight projects in Europe?</strong></p>\n<p>Here is what the R&amp;I foresight experts believe contributed to the success of their projects: Top of the list of critical success factors - mentioned by almost all respondents - is high-level commitment and support from government representatives. Ensuring cross-sectoral stakeholder engagement was another frequently cited factor. Leveraging existing networks or databases of expertise was also cited as a critical success factor, as it enables the rapid mobilisation of the right experts. But how can we ensure that we reach the relevant people and keep them engaged?</p>\n<p>Several R&amp;I foresight experts stressed the importance of defining and communicating a clear purpose for the project and explaining why it is important and worth stakeholders' time, as well as demonstrating that foresight can add value in the context of today's R&amp;I challenges. What can foresight achieve and what are its limitations? Transparency of methods also contributes to credibility. Facilitating direct interaction between participants in creative settings has the potential to be beneficial, allowing for more dynamic and contextually rich foresight outcomes. The R&amp;I foresight experts noted that it is important to allow sufficient time for interactive discussions. Wherever possible, the setting should be face-to-face.</p>\n<p>Yet, these R&amp;I foresight projects have not always gone to plan. Bottlenecks identified include recurring ones such as insufficient time for comprehensive analysis and stakeholder engagement, or financial constraints that can prevent in-depth trend analysis and essential foresight activities. It can also be time-consuming to mobilise a diverse group of experts and policy-makers for participatory exercises, which can be a challenge in a time-critical project. Short-term thinking and a reluctance to challenge established beliefs can hinder the exploration of alternative futures and stifle innovative foresight efforts. Others reported the \"impact gap\" and their struggle to ensure that foresight results influence decision making, often exacerbated by an over-reliance on written summaries that lack engaging communication methods. Finally, maintaining objectivity in horizon-scanning activities and avoiding the pitfalls of techno-optimism can also be challenging.</p>\n<p><strong>What's next? Trends in R&amp;I foresight</strong></p>\n<p>The report provides answers to those curious about the new frontiers and trends in the use of R&amp;I foresight. Whether it's the integration of AI and machine learning technologies into foresight practices, the representation of future generations and nature in foresight processes, speculative and design-based approaches or debiasing techniques, the methods of R&amp;I foresight are constantly evolving.</p>\n<p>For those wishing to expand their networks, the report also provides an overview of international and European (R&amp;I) foresight networks, national (R&amp;I) foresight networks, networks focusing on technology assessment, and examples of regular (R&amp;I) foresight conferences or conferences with sessions dedicated to R&amp;I foresight.</p>\n<p>This stocktaking report is a snapshot of the status quo of R&amp;I foresight actors in Europe. However, new innovative projects are being implemented as you read this article. As the Eye of Europe project consortium, we are committed to strengthening fora for exchange among R&amp;I practitioners interested in foresight methodologies. Let's continue the lively discussions on the Futures4Europe platform to shape tomorrow's R&amp;I agendas together.</p>\n","methods":[],"pageTypes":[{"popularity":126,"name":"project result","_id":"649a0649-abfd-43c3-86d5-2765c99f7f31","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:51:01.712Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:51:01.712Z"},"tagId":252529,"tagType":"page type"}],"_id":"4aff5bd1-9ae5-41fb-b30e-476ad2d91d9a","_owner":"f677c1bb-4334-4039-a211-fdd89e013a3c","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-10-14T16:45:28.032Z"},"postContentRIch3":"<p></p>\n","domains":[{"popularity":67,"name":"EU R&I policy","_id":"74f1a07e-9754-4e06-9091-30d0d7d4e667","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:25.091Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:25.091Z"},"tagType":"domain"}],"postImage1":{"url":"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/471908_7eb5dc3284a4490da0c64d78091b6da4~mv2.png","caption":"R&I foresight actors in Europe which contributed to this stocktaking exercise\n"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-10-23T08:12:33.238Z"},"slug":"Showcasing_Perspectives__hjkqa","moderators":[],"pageOwner":[],"eventStartDate":{},"speakers":[],"organisations":[{"popularity":21,"tagline":"Deutsches Zentrum Fur Luft - Und Raumfahrt","name":"DLR","_id":"902becad-0a91-4957-95de-c83c65e80b0f","_createdDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.823Z"},"_updatedDate":{"$date":"2024-08-27T09:48:24.823Z"},"tagType":"organisation"}],"postContentRIch1":"<p>The European foresight community has experienced remarkable growth in recent years.
